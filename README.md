# Signature Diffusion

In one sentence: generate time series using a diffusion model in the signature space

# TODOs 
- [] Finish up the mathematical formulation and understand the space of signatures: is it a Banach space? what kind of space is it? 
- [] Determine evaluation tasks and especially how ts generation were handled recently.
